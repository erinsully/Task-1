<h2> My School </h2>

<br/>
I transferred to my school last semester from another school in Rhode Island. I major in Communications and Video Production and I love it. My favorite part about my school is the people I’ve met and how passionate the professors are. I’m hoping to go to the Cannes Film Festival next year with my class. I would recommend this school to anyone! I have met so many amazing people that I’m so lucky to know.

<h2> Fun Stuff </h2>

While living in New Haven in my own apartment I get to do a lot of fun stuff. I live with three roommates who are also my best friends so it is the dream situation for me. I like to workout, hang out with my roommates, and walk around our awesome neighborhood. One of my favorite things to do for fun is hang out with our neighbor’s dog, a chocolate lab named Leica. I love New Haven and I’m never bored. I feel like I’m living my dream life.
